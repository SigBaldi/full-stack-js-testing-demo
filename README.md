This code backs up my talk about [browser-monkey](https://github.com/featurist/browser-monkey) testing library.

Clone this and `npm install`.

Run tests in Chrome with `npm test-karma`

Run tests in Electron with `npm test-electron`

TODO: Run tests in node (via virtual dom) with `npm run test-vdom`
